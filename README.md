# Twitcher (Twitter Clone)

This is a project that taught me skills in both frontend development and backend development to create a fullstack site similar to social media sites like twitter.com (formally known as X). It uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to connect to a web service that I made in python using the Flask library to handle different routes and connections. It also uses Amazon Web Services to store data with NoSQL DynamoDB such as different posts, accounts, and images that a user might input into the project.
